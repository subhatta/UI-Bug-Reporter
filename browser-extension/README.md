## Link Testing Logic

The extension tests different types of links:

- **HTTP/HTTPS Links**: Makes network requests to check accessibility
- **Anchor Links (#)**: Verifies the target element exists on the page
- **Protocol Links**: Validates mailto: and tel: links as working
- **External Links**: Tests links to other domains (subject to CORS policies)

## Report Format

Email reports include:
- Page URL and title
- Test timestamp
- Total number of links tested
- List of broken links with error details
- List of working links
- Generated by signature

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
- Refresh the webpage and try again
- Check that the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
- Ensure you're on an HTTP/HTTPS website (not chrome:// pages)

### Links Not Being Detected
- Some dynamic content may need page reload
- Single-page applications might require re-activation after navigation

### Email Not Opening
- Ensure you have a default email client configured
- On some systems, you may need to copy the report content manually
